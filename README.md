Logistic regression is a statistical and machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems, where the output variable has two possible outcomes (e.g., presence or absence of disease). It models the probability of a specific class as a function of one or more input features. Logistic regression is widely used in healthcare, finance, and social sciences due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness.
